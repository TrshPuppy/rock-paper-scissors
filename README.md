JavaScript rock paper scissors game

This is a project for The [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors). 
The requirements for this project is to create a rock, paper, scissors game which can be played in the browser console between a user and a computer.
Per the Odin Project, the game will eventually also include a GUI to be designed later in the curriculum.

*ENJOY!*

Update: This game now has an UI made w/ HTML, CSS, and Javascript! The UI is based on requirements from the Odin Project. The UI also includes a pixelart background and pixelart button animations all of which I created myself.

Total time spent: 19 hours.
